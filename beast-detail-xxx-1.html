          The Doxy, sometimes referred to as the Biting Fairy, was a small Fairy-like magical beast, sometimes mistaken for a Fairy. The Doxy was covered in coarse black hair, and had an additional set of arms and legs. Doxies had shiny beetle-like wings, and a double row of sharp teeth. If bitten, a wizard or witch should take an antidote immediately, as their venom was highly poisonous. Doxies buried their eggs underground, and Doxy Queens can lay up to five-hundred at once. The eggs generally hatched in two to three weeks.

          Preferring cold climates, the Doxy was found throughout Northern Europe and North America. Doxies were considered pests. They can infest houses, taking up residence in the draperies. Removing them required a good supply of Doxycide. Alternatively, they can be dispatched with a simple Knockback Jinx, as doxies were particularly vulnerable to it, excluding the queens, Cormac McLaggen was known to have eaten a pound of Doxy eggs for a bet, making him unable to try out for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team in his 6th year at Hogwarts.

          Fred and George Weasley used Doxy venom for their Skiving Snackboxes, sold at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Harold Dingle used Doxy droppings to pretend it was powdered Dragon claw to sell to fifth years, but was confiscated by Hermione Granger.
