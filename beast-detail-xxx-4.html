          he Billywig's wings were attached to the top of its head rotated extremely fast, spinning the Billywig so that it could fly. Xenophilius Lovegood used Billywig wings for his recreation of Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem because he believed they "induce an elevated frame of mind".

        <p>
          The Billywig also had a long, thin stinger at the bottom of its body. Anyone stung by a Billywig would suffer giddiness, followed by levitation, which is what gave the Billywig its rating of XXX. This was also why young Australian wizards and witches tried to catch Billywigs and provoke them into stinging them. Too many stings, however, could cause the victim to hover uncontrollably for days on end. Sometimes, the victim would suffer from a severe allergic reaction, and permanent floating may have ensued.

          In 1926, several Billywigs escaped Newt Scamander's suitcase during his visit to New York.

          Dried Billywig stings were used as ingredients in several potions, and were believed to be a component in Fizzing Whizzbees.
