          A Niffler was a magical beast with a long snout and a coat of black, fluffy fur. They were attracted to shiny things, which made them wonderful for locating treasure, but that also meant that they could wreak havoc if kept (or set loose) indoors. Nifflers in general are usually harmless. Students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry learnt about Nifflers in Care of Magical Creatures class, an elective that could be chosen in the third year of their education. Nifflers were assigned to Curse-Breakers by the Gringotts Head Goblin to burrow underground in search of treasures hidden in cursed sites.

          Nifflers were rodent-like creatures with a long snout similar to that of a platypus and a coat of black, fluffy fur.[1] Native to Britain, they lived in burrows as deep as twenty feet below ground, and females produced six to eight young in a single litter. </p>

         <p> A Niffler's pouch can hold numerous items, Nifflers had a pouch on their bellies which held far more than at first seemed possible, like the effects of an Undetectable Extension Charm on a container. </p>

        <p> Nifflers were gentle by nature and could even be affectionate towards their owners. However, they could destroy belongings looking for sparkly objects, and for that reason it was inadvisable to keep them as a house pet. It was also implied that they could turn vicious if provoked, as the second Niffler released into Dolores Umbridge's office apparently tried to take a chunk out of her leg.

        Newton Scamander owned a niffler, which escaped twice from his suitcase during his visit to New York in 1926 and tried to rob both the Steen National Bank and a jewel shop of numerous valuables.

          Newt Scamander wrote in his book that Nifflers were black-haired. In Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, the hair baby Nifflers are shown with other colours, suggesting that other colours were rare or that Niffler hair darkens when they age.
