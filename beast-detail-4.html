          They possessed diminutive intelligence, and lived mainly in woodlands or glades. The fairy was a vain creature, and would often allow itself to be used as decoration by wizardkind. Due to their vanity, fairies were almost constantly grooming themselves. They possessed a weak brand of magic that allowed it to evade its predators such as the Augurey.

          The fairy could not speak; instead, it made a high-pitched buzzing noise to communicate with its fellow fairies, but they were able to laugh in a similar way to the Flitterbies playful buzzing with the wings.Their wings were used as an ingredient in certain potions; removing their wings, while it would not kill them, tended to cause them extreme annoyance, as it did not play to their vanity.

          Fairies could lay up to fifty eggs in one go, laying them on the underside of leaves. The eggs hatched into brightly coloured larvae, and, at six-to-ten days, they span themselves into a cocoon. They emerged a month later as adult fairies. Bowtruckles ate fairy eggs.[1]

          Muggles' impression of the fairy was a generous one, having been ingrained into children's minds in the form of "fairy tales". Wizards believed that, of all the magical creatures in the world, the fairy, along with the unicorn, had received the best Muggle "press".
