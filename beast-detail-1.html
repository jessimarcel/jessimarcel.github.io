        <p>
          A Clabbert was a magical tree-dwelling beast that resembled a cross between a monkey and a frog. Its pustules were used in Potion-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its smooth skin was mottled green, and it had short horns and a wide grinning mouth full of razor sharp teeth. Its long arms and webbed hands and feet allowed it to move gracefully through the trees. On the Clabbert's forehead was a large pustule which flashed red when the Clabbert sensed danger. It fed on small lizards and birds.</p><br>

          <p>The Clabbert was generally found in the southern states of America, but can now be found worldwide. American wizards and witches used to keep Clabberts to give them early warning about approaching Muggles. The International Confederation of Wizards were forced to introduce fines to stop this. Despite looking nice at night, a tree full of glowing Clabbert pustules caused curious Non-magical neighbours to wonder why the Wizards still had their Christmas lights up in June. </p><br>

        <p>
          The word "Clabber" is a Scottish and Anglo-Irish word for "mud", "soft dirt", and "wet clay". In US dialect, it means "to curdle" or the way to mix a milk.
