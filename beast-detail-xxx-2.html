          The Murtlap was a magical marine beast resembling a rat with a growth on its back resembling a sea anemone, found on the coastal areas of Britain. The favoured prey of the Murtlap were crustaceans, though they also went for the feet of any human foolish enough to step on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The growth on the Murtlap's back may be pickled and eaten to improve one's resistance to jinxes, although eating an excess of pickled murtlap may cause one to grow unsightly purple ear hair. Murtlap Essence was a home remedy for cuts and abrasions. Murtlap tentacles were included in Murtlap Essence which Hermione let Harry dip his hand in to heal the cuts after his detention with Dolores Umbridge.[2] Getting bit by a Murltlap was usually not serious, but some serious reactions to it can cause sweating, twitching and flames out of the anus.

          A Murtlap escaped from Newton Scamander's suitcase during his visit to New York in 1926 and attacked No-Maj Jacob Kowalski. Newton Scamander and Porpentina Goldstein found Jacob unconscious after the attack and when the responsible Murtlap burst from hiding, Newt quickly grabbed it and put it back in his case.

          Murtlap Essence is a solution of strained and pickled tentacles of Murtlaps. It soothes painful cuts and abrasions, and helps them to heal.
