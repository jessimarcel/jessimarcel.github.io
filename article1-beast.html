        <p>The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures is the second largest department in
           the Ministry of Magic. It is divided into three divisions named after the three categorisations of magical
           creatures: Being, Beast, and Spirit. It also houses the liaison offices for Goblins and Centaurs. 
        </p><br>

        <p> The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures of the Ministry of Magic is responsible for overseeing and regulating magical creatures. It is divided into three divisions: the Beast Division, the Being Division, and the Spirit.  </p><br>

        <p> A "being" is generally defined, according to Fantastic Beasts, as "any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws." This includes humans, dwarves, house-elves, giants, goblins, hags, veelas, and vampires. Fairies, pixies, gnomes, and most other creatures are classified as "beasts." Affairs related to ghosts come under the auspices of the Spirit Division.  </p><br>

        <p> The definition is not without its problems: Werewolves and Animagi are typically in human form, but may transform into an animal. (A werewolf transforms from the human state only at the full moon, but an Animagus is a human who has learned to transform into an animal at will.) Their classification is unclear, and offices responsible for werewolves exist in both the Beast and Being Divisions. Banshees and Dementors have never been officially classified. (See below.) Centaurs, leprechauns and merpeople (mermaids and mermen) have rejected "being" status in favour of "beast" status. </p><br>

        <p> The fictional Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them book also assigns a threat rating to each creature, in the form of "X" marks. Five Xs means "Known wizard killer/impossible to domesticate". Four Xs means "Dangerous/requires specialist knowledge/skilled wizard may handle". Three means "Competent wizard should cope". Two means "Harmless/may be domesticated". One means "boring". Creatures that need to be treated with a sophisticated amount of respect, e.g. Centaurs, Unicorns, Phoenixes, and merpeople, are given a XXXX rating. ≠ </p><br>

        <p>Beast Division <br></p>
        <p>The Beast Division is one of the three divisions under the control of the department. It deals with all
        duties and problems concerning those magical creatures classified as a "Beast" by the Ministry.</p><br>
            
        <p> A classification is given by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to all known Beasts, Beings and Spirits. These offer an at-a-glance guide to the perceived danger level of a creature. There are five categories. The department is located on the fourth level of the Ministry of Magic, and includes the following
        divisions: </p><br>
            <br>
            <p>XXXXX - Known wizard killer / impossible to train or domesticate </p>
            <p> XXXX - Dangerous / requires specialist knowledge / skilled wizard may handle </p>
            <p> XXX - Competent wizard should cope </p> 
            <p> XX - Harmless / may be domesticated </p>
            <p> X - Boring </p>
            <br>

          <br><p>Being Division </p><br>
          <p>The Being Division is one of the three divisions under the control of this department. It deals with all
          duties and problems concerning those magical creatures classified as a "Being" by the Ministry.</p><br>

          

          <p>A Being is one of the three classifications used by the British Ministry of Magic to catalogue the various magical Creatures that inhabit the wizarding world (the others being Beast and Spirit).
          The definition of a Being is "any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws". The current definition was laid down by Minister for Magic Grogan Stump in 1811, and the Being Division was formed as part of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.</p>

          <p><br>

          The definition of "Being" has had a long and troubled history. In the fourteenth century, Burdock Muldoon, Chief of the Wizards' Council, attempted to define Beings as any member of the magical community that walked on two legs. Muldoon invited all Beings to a summit to discuss new magical laws, and saw that his definition was unworkable. Goblins had brought with them every creature they could find with two legs, including Diricawls, Augureys, Fwoopers, Pixies, Fairies, and Trolls, and the summit descended into chaos when the Trolls started to destroy the chamber with their clubs. </p><br>


          <p> Muldoon's successor, Elfrida Clagg attempted to redefine Beings as those that could speak the Human tongue. However, there were still problems at the next summit. Trolls were still classed as Beings since they could be taught the Human tongue, and Jarveys were in attendance. The Centaurs refused to take part since the Merpeople were excluded, as Mermish cannot be understood above water. Ghosts, who had not been classed as Beings under Muldoon since they glided, left in disgust at the Council's emphasis on matters of the living over matters of the dead. </p><br>

          <p>In 1811, Grogan Stump laid down the new definition of a Being, to the agreement of the magical community, along with the definition of a "Beast". However, the Ghosts were still sensitive to be classed as Beings since they were dead, and a new definition, "Spirit" was created for them. <br></p>

          <p>Humans (Muggles and wizards and witches) are beings, though there are extremists who campaign for the classification of Muggles as Beasts. Goblins, vampires, hags, giants, house-elves, veela, and werewolves in their human form are also given this status. It is important to note that when there is a full moon the werewolf in its transformed state would be classified as a beast and not a being. <br></p>

          <p> Merpeople and centaurs were offered this status, but refused because they did not want to be grouped with creatures such as hags and vampires and are by default classified as Beasts.<br></p>

          <p>Other creatures fit the qualifications that define Being (intelligent speech), such as Acromantulas, Sphinxes, Manticores, and Erklings but were not even offered Being status due to their extremely violent and even lethal tendencies. They are also classified as Beasts.<br></p>

          <p>Dementors and Boggarts, on the other hand, are neither a Being nor a Beast, as they are non-beings.<br></p>
