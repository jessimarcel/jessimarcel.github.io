          Some of this is apparently by design: It seems the author and screenwriter J.K. Rowling is trying a retcon, reshaping the original Potter lore with new details. But the canon is still key, and more than any previous Potter film, this sequel to “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” requires you to have read — and retained! — information from all of the books and fake textbooks, too. Here’s a crash course to help you make sense of the movie’s big twist. (Spoiler alert: Events in the movie’s finale will be discussed.) The Dumbledores’ father, Percival, sought revenge against the Muggle boys and was locked up in Azkaban for attacking them. Ariana was subsequently kept under a form of house arrest — prevented from attending Hogwarts and only allowed out at night. When she was just 14, she accidentally killed her mother, Kendra, in an explosion of uncontrolled magic.

        <p><i>Eddie Redmayne stars as Newt Scamander, a “magizoologist” with a suitcase full of creatures in “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” the second installment of the J.K. Rowling series––Warner Bros.</i></p>

          The team behind “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” throws an awful lot at the screen during this clotted two-hour-plus diversion, the latest installment in the J.K. Rowling-verse. As is often the case in a Rowling production, evil is ascendant, seeping through both human and magic realms like poison gas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mostly, though, because Rowling builds worlds, what “Grindelwald” has is a great deal of story. The movie is chockablock with stuff: titular creatures (if not nearly enough), attractive people, scampering extras, eye-catching locations, tragic flashbacks, teary confessions and largely bloodless, spectacular violence. It’s an embarrassment of riches, and it’s suffocating.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the second movie in what promises (threatens!) to be an extended “Fantastic Beasts” franchise. (Rowling spun this series out of the “Harry Potter” cycle, so subfranchise might be more correct.)
