          It all started in the 20s! </i>Would you believe we started out as a small community of two person? It's true. Way back in 2008, we were called our selve <i>The Potter Head</i>––even until now––but truth is this dream would never become one amazing reality without the help of other people who support us throughout the begining, especially to the parents who've always share the same dream in 2000 when the books start to entering their life. A small community of all the readers become some kind of a tradition until it's passed down to the children who share the same passion and dream.

        <p>
          Starting from building a little reading community in the University, we gather some people who just wants to have a fun reading and the other who want to make it a bigger part of their life. This isn't just a mere website, this is part of ourselves, compassion, and all the fun that we want to share to the whole wide world. We truly believe that there's so many people out there who might share the same passion like us––and we were right about that! Greetings, to all the magizoologist who've been with us for the past two years, cheers!

          Back to the topic, We start this website in the 2018 because the lack of information that we got on the Internet about all of this amazing creatures. And i think it'll be really great to share the information and making this precious community bigger! Last but not least, we hope that you all can support our little community! we also welcome all the new-comers, let's be part of this lovely family.
