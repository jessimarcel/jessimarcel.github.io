          A Grindylow is a small, horned, pale-green skinned water demon native to Great Britain and Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first stage of a Grindylow's life cycle is the larval stage, where it is referred to as a Grypt. It is also known by several local names, such as a "Pollywiggle" in Ilkley, a "Candypole" in Kettlewell, and a "Jarvis" in Sheffield.[
        </p>
        <p>
          Aggressive towards witches, wizards and muggles alike, the Grindylow has only ever been tamed by merpeople; the half-fish water dwellers who sometimes keep them as pets.
        </p>

        <p> Grindylows survive, for the most part, on fish, algae, and small sea creatures; however, occasionally they will eat humans (it is for this reason that they are classified as dark creatures).</p>

        <p>The Grindylow is particularly prevalent in Yorkshire, where it displays a large amount of physical variation. It is generally found in still or stagnant water. In more recent years, Grindylows have taken to urban environments such as Porter Beach in the heart of Sheffield, where they shelter in submerged shopping trolleys and traffic cones.</p>

        <p>The Grindylow is a sickly green colour, with green teeth and small pointy horns on its head. It has long, strong (albeit brittle) fingers which it uses to strangle its prey, and is a rather good swimmer, since it is adapted to live in water.</p>

        <p>The Grindylow has long, brittle fingers which despite their fragility are rather strong. The trick to escaping a Grindylow is to break their grip on a person; it can also be noted that the Revulsion Jinx may help with this task, as underwater it shoots jets of boiling hot water. The Ebublio Jinx is also highly useful when dealing with them underwater.</p>
