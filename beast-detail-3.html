          The Bowtruckle was a hand-sized, insect-eating, tree dwelling magical beast with long sharp fingers (two on each hand), brown eyes, and a general appearance of a flat-faced stick figure made of bark and twigs, which served well as camouflage in its natural habitat. They were immensely difficult to spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bowtruckle could be found in western England, southern Germany, and certain Scandinavian forests. A Bowtruckle served as a tree guardian for its home tree, which was usually a tree whose wood was of wand quality (such as a Wiggentree). The twig-like fingers were well adapted for digging out wood lice in trees and can also be used as a weapon against a foe when aimed at the eyes.

          It was generally a peaceful creature, but it may attempt to gouge out an attacker's eyes if anything threatened its tree or itself, and is adept at dodging most types of charms. In order to take leaves or wood from a Bowtruckle's tree one would have to offer it wood lice or fairy eggs as a distraction. A group of Bowtruckles was called a branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bowtruckle in a Care of Magical Creatures lesson during the 1987–1988 school year Newt Scamander kept a branch of Bowtruckles in his suitcase by December 1926. </p>

          <p> During the 1987–1988 school year, Bowtruckles were studied by fourth year Care of Magical Creatures students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, taught by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn, who described them to be slipperier than Frog Spawn Soap. One of the Bowtruckles was named by Jacob's sibling, and was named either Jacob, Barnaby Junior or Newt, after a person of the same name.</p>

          <p> Bowtruckles were studied by fifth year Care of Magical Creatures students at Hogwarts during 1995–1996 school year, taught by substitute Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.
